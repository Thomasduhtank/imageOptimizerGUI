# Mass Image Optimizer

This tool will open a little GUI where you pick a folder and it will optimize all images inside that folder for you.

## What this does

- Gets all images that are not already optimized
- optimize all images by resizing to the maximum width set by you (default: 1000px wide). Images will obviously scale correctly and keep aspect ratio.
- Create a thumbnail called thumb_IMAGENAME (the next version will make this optional as not everyone needs it)
- optimize your image to the percentage set by you (default: 80%, you can go as low as 30%)
- Save the optimized image with your chosen prefix (default: optimized_)

## Upcoming features:
- Make thumbnails configurable
- ~create config gui~ already done
- Your suggestions!

## Installation
Just open the downloaded file and a file dialog will open to let you choose the folder to optimize.
